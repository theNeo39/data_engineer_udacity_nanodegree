# **Data Engineering Projects**

Currently in-progress with udacity data engineering nano degree.
Completed 2 out of 6 projects from the nano degree.

## **Project 1:Data Modeling with Postgres**
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. 
All the data is in JSON format and they would like to have a Postgres database with star schema data modelling to optimize the queries for analysis and bulid ETL pipeline using python.
They are particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

## **Project 2:Data Modeling with Cassandra**
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app. 
This project requires data modeling with Apache Cassandra and an ETL pipeline using Python. With this use case we were able to query information like
1. Get the song details in music app history for a particular session.
2. Get the name of artist and songs played by the particular user in specific session.
3. Get all the users who listened to specific song.
